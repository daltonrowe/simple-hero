# Home Landing Page

On the logged out site homepage, in `app/views/home/index.html.erb` create a landing page for Simpleteam.

The landing page should consist of a few main sections:

- Header: Large spacer containing a minimal tag line about getting things done simply. Contains a button linking to the sign up page at `new_registration_path`
- Features: Display three cards to Status, Retros, and Data Store
- - Status: Emphasis the ability to quickly share team updates and use standup for actual meaningful conversation.
- - Retros (Coming Soon): Sync and foster discussion about what the teams needs to improve.
- - Data Store: All team members to easily store non-critical data about development processes.
- Get Started CTA: Final section prompting the user to sign up, and get started without thinking too hard. Contains a button linking to the sign up page at `new_registration_path`

The landing page should be responsive.

Do not create any new View Components.
